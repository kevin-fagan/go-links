Go Links is a lightweight, self-hosted application for creating easy-to-remember vanity URLs. Great for internal tools, sites or personal projects.

- 🌐 Easy-to-use vanity URLs
- 📤 Ability to export your data 
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight with minimal dependencies
- 📝 Built-in audit trail — every link change is recorded for traceability
- 🔒 Fully self-hosted — you maintain complete control over your data and links
