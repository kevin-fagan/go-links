Go Links is a lightweight, self-hosted application for creating easy-to-remember vanity URLs — great for teams, internal tools, or personal projects. 
Instead of sharing or remembering long, complex links, you can create short aliases such as `go/standup`, `go/jira`, or `go/mockups`.

- 🌐 Vanity URLs
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — minimal dependencies
- 🔒 Self-hosted — you control your data and links
