Go Links is a lightweight, self-hosted application for creating easy-to-remember vanity URLs — perfect for teams, internal tools, or personal projects. 
Instead of sharing long, complex links, create short aliases like go/standup, go/jira, or go/mockups to quickly access frequently used resources.
- 🌐 Simple, memorable vanity URLs (e.g. go/meet, go/design-doc)
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — minimal dependencies
- 🔒 Self-hosted — you control your data and links
