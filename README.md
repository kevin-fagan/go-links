Go Links is a lightweight, self-hosted application for creating easy-to-remember vanity URLs. Great for internal tools, sites or personal projects.
Instead of sharing or having to rember long, complex URLs, you can create short aliases such as `go/standup` or `go/jira`.

- 🌐 Easy-to-use vanity URLs
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight with minimal dependencies
- 🔒 Fully self-hosted — you maintain complete control over your data and links
